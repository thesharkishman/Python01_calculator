# Python Ex01 :  A simple calculator

## Task
Let's create a simple text based calculator that performs operations on 2 numbers, 
which includes basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

So, in the end, you need to have a script that 
- first asks the user what operations needs to be performed,
- then asks user to input the 2 operands
- prints the results to terminal

## What you would need to know
- Functions
- Datatypes
- Errors
- Arithmetic and logical operators

## Usage
- Fork and clone this repo
- Make or add changes to the functions in [`calculator.py`](./calculator.py)
	- Once you're confident of the functional changes, push the code to Github, and wait for Github to check your code
	- For Github Actions to work properly, please don't change anything in `tests` folder
	- If everything comes back alright, go ahead with designing the user input side of the code
- If you need something a little more challenging, then also try writing the integer division function
	- I haven't written extensive tests for this yet, but you could test them out yourself
	- Pay attention to operations including negative numbers	
- If in doubt, Google
