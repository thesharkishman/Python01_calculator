# Python Ex01 :  A simple calculator

## Task
Let's create a simple text based calculator that performs operations on 2 numbers, 
which includes basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

 </p>


So, in the end, you need to have a `python3` script that 
- first asks the user what operations needs to be performed,
- then asks user to input the 2 operands
- prints the results to terminal

If you need something a little more challenging, then 
- also try writing the integer division function
	- I haven't written extensive tests for this yet, but you could test them out yourself
	- Pay attention to operations including negative numbers
- try putting the calculator in a loop so that after performing one operation, the user has the choice to carry out more or exit


## What you would need to know
- [Functions](https://github.com/hsrwrobotics/Robotics_club_lectures/tree/master/Week%202/Functions)
- Datatypes
- Errors
- Arithmetic and logical operators

## Usage
- Fork and clone this repo
- Make or add changes to the functions in [`calculator.py`](./calculator.py)
	- Once you're confident of the functional changes, push the code to Github, and wait for Github to check your code
		- after pushing the code, go to the web repo page, click on the `Actions` tab
		- if everything is working as expected, you should see green ticks or a pass message 
		- it might take a few minutes to complete, since the tests run on 4 versions of python
		- For Github Actions to work properly, please don't change anything in `tests` folder
	- If everything comes back alright, go ahead with designing the user input side of the code
	
- If in doubt, Google
