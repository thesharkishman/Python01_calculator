So, in the end, you need to have a script that 
- first asks the user what operations needs to be performed,
- then asks user to input the 2 operands
- prints the results to terminal

## What you would need to know
- Functions
- Datatypes
- Errors
- Arithmetic and logical operators

## Usage
- Fork and clone this repo
- Make or add changes to the functions in [`calculator.py`](./calculator.py)
 - Once you're confident of the functional changes, push the code to Github, and wait for Github to check your code
 - If everything comes back alright, go ahead with deisgning the user input side of the code
 - If in doubt, Google
